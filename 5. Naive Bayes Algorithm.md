# Naive Bayes Algorithm

It is based on Bayes theorem and is one of the most adopted algorithms when it comes to text mining. It is supervised and depends on the probabilities of the events to occur. It's considered to have  na√Øve because of the independence of one attribute in a class with respect to others, which means it does not hold any dependence with two attributes having the same class.

1.  Independent events : When you toss two different coins, the toss results of the two coins is independendent to each other. The probability will not be chnaged for the events.
2.  Dependedt events : Not paying your power bill on time and having your power cut off. The probability will be changed for the events.
 
Probability of an event is defined as the ratio of the number of trails of the occurrence of an event to the total number of trails. 

**_Exmaple_:** If we randomly pick 10 balls from a bag which contains both red and blue balls and 4 out of 10 are found to be red balls, then the probability of red balls is 4/10 or 0.4.

**Joint Probability**

It can be defined as a chance or likelihood that two events will happen at the same time although they remain independent on each other. This also implies that the outcome of one event cannot influence the outcome of others.

**Conditional Probability**

It is the probability of the outcome of an event given that another event has already occurred. If A and B are two events, then the conditional probability of both the events is given by

**Suppose there are two events called A and B then Probability of A given B = Probability of A intersection B divided by Probability of B**

##### Naive Bayes assumes that
1. one event in a class should be independent of another event belonging to the same class.
2. predictors have an equal effect on the outcomes or responses in the data.
