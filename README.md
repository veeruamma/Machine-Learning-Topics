## Linear Regression 
It is a method used to find the relationship between the outcome variable also known as the dependent variable, and one or more variable often called as independent variables. This method is mostly used for forecasting. There are different rehression techniques based on the number of independent varibales and the type of realtionship between varibales.

Regression 
* Performed when the type of dependent or target varibale is continuous and independent variable could be continuous or categorical or nominal. 
* Tries to find the best fit line, which shows the relationship between dependent and independent variables with least error.

**The impact of change in independent varibales on the dependent variable can be described using the best fit line.**

Best fit line equation for linear regression is **y= mx + c**,  where m is slope and c is intercept or constant
