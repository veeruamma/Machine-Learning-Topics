# Machine-Learning-Topics
Projects worked on machine learning algorithms

## Linear Regression 

Best fit line equation for linear regression is **y= mx + c**
>where m is slope and c is intercept or constant



## Logistic Regression 

## Decision Tree 

## Support Vector Machine(SVM) 

## Naive Bayes 

## K-nearest neighbour

## K-means 

## Random Forest

## Gradient Boosting algorithms
1.  GBM
2.  XGBoost
3.  LightGBM
4.  CatBoost
