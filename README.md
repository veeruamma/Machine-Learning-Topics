## Linear Regression 
It is a method used to find the relationship between the outcome variable also known as the dependent variable, and one or more variable often called as independent variables. This method is mostly used for forecasting. There are different rehression techniques based on the number of independent varibales and the type of realtionship between varibales.

Regression 
* Performed when the type of dependent or target varibale is continuous and independent variable could be continuous or categorical or nominal. 
* Tries to find the best fit line, which shows the relationship between dependent and independent variables with least error.

**The impact of change in independent varibales on the dependent variable can be described using the best fit line.**

Best fit line equation for linear regression is **y= mx + c**,  where m is slope and c is intercept or constant

#### Simple Linear Regression : If there is only input/independent varibale. y = mx + c, trying to find the best m and c values for y and x. Just a line
#### Multiple Linear Regression : If there are more than one input/independent varibale. y = m1x1 + m2x2 + ... +c, trying to find the best set of m and c values. It's a plane

### Assumptions for Linear Regression models
1. Linearity : should have linear relationship b/w input and output variables.
2. Multicollinearity : two or more input variables shouldn't be highly correlated
3. Homoscedasticity : residuals should be homoscedasticity that means variance of error are constant across input variables
4. Multivariate Normality : residuals should be normally distributed.
5. Categorical data : categorical data should be converted into dummy variables.
6. Minimum records : at least of 20 records of input variables needed.

#### Polynomial Regression : It is a non-linear regression and relationship of output variable is fitted to nth degree of the input variable.
