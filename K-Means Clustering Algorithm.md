# K-Means Clustering Algorithm

It's one of the unsupervised machine learnign algorithms that groups or classifies data points, based on several similarities in the data set which allows certain patterns to evolve upon which the prediction is done.

Clustering is to group similar objects that are highly dissimilar in nature. For a better understanding of clustering, we need to differentiate the concept of **Heterogeneity between the groups and Homogeneity within the groups.** 

##### For a better understanding of clustering, a graphical representation is shown below:
