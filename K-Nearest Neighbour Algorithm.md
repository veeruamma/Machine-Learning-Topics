# K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm

KNN belongs to a group of lazy learners where as logistic, SVM, Neural Nets belong to Eager Learners. Lazy learners store the training data in memory and arranges the data in order to find the closest neighbours efficiently during the inference phase. Otherwise, it will have to compare every new case with whole dataset making it quite inefficient.

**Eager Learners :** During the training phase, the algorithm tries learn the best fit line that need a lot computations and take a lot of time.
**Lazy Learners :** They don't involve many computations and hence train much faster.
